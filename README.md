## What is a Button in Android?

A **Button** is a UI element that users can tap to perform an action. Buttons are defined in XML layout files and handled in Java using `setOnClickListener`.

Example:
```java
Button myButton = findViewById(R.id.myButton);
myButton.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    // Your code here
});
